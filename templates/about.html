                            <p><b>Phishing</b> is a type of social engineering scam in which attackers manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information or downloading malicious software, </p>
                            <p>such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware.</p>
                            <p>These attacks have grown more advanced over time, often closely replicating the targeted website.</p>
                            <p>This enables attackers to monitor the victim's activity as they interact with the site, including bypassing security measures alongside the victim.</p>
                            <p>The term "phishing" was first documented in 1995 within the cracking toolkit AOHell, though it may have appeared earlier in the hacker magazine 2600.</p>
                            <p>The name, derived from "fishing," symbolizes the use of bait to "fish" for sensitive information. </p>
                            <p>Efforts to prevent or mitigate phishing attacks include legislation, user education, public awareness campaigns, and implementing technical security measures.</p>
                            <p>Awareness of phishing has become increasingly critical in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
                            <p>Phishing incidents among businesses grew from 72% in 2017 to 86% in 2020 and further surged to 94% by 2023.</p>
                            <p>Here are some common types of phishing attacks, along with explanations and examples:</p>

                            <h3>Email Phishing</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from a trusted source, tricking</p>
                            <p>recipients into sharing sensitive information or clicking malicious links.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>An email that looks like it's from a bank, urging the recipient to "confirm your account details" </p>
                            <p>by clicking on a fake link and entering credentials on a counterfeit login page.</p>
                            <h3>Spear Phishing</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>A targeted form of phishing where attackers customize messages based on specific information about the victim (e.g., job role, organization).</p>  
                            <p><b>Example:</b> A scam email sent to a company's finance manager, pretending to be the CEO, requesting an urgent wire transfer to a "partner account."</p>
                            <h3>Whaling (CEO Fraud)</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>A specialized type of spear phishing targeting high-profile individuals such as executives or senior management</p>
                            <p><b>Example:</b>An attacker impersonates a company's CEO via email, requesting sensitive data from the HR department, such as employee tax records.</p>
                            <h3>Smishing (SMS Phishing)</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Phishing attacks conducted through text messages, designed to lure victims into clicking malicious links or sharing personal information.</p>  
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A text claiming to be from a delivery service, asking the recipient to click a link to "reschedule" a package delivery, leading to a fake website.</p>
                            <h3>Vishing (Voice Phishing)</h3>
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Phishing attacks carried out over phone calls, where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to extract confidential details.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A scammer claiming to be from tech support, warning the victim of a "security breach" and convincing them to provide remote access to their computer.</p>
                            <h3>Pharming</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Instead of directly contacting victims, attackers manipulate DNS settings to redirect users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>When a user tries to access their bank’s website, they are redirected to a fake site that looks identical, where they enter their login credentials.</p>
                            <h3>Clone Phishing</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>An attacker copies a legitimate email (e.g., a newsletter or confirmation email) and modifies it to include malicious links or attachments.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A fake version of a flight confirmation email that includes a link to "check-in," leading to a malicious site.</p>
                            <h3>Man-in-the-Middle Phishing</h3>
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Attackers intercept communications between a user and a legitimate service, gaining unauthorized access to information.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>An attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot labeled "Free Wi-Fi," allowing them to monitor user traffic and steal login credentials when users log in to accounts.</p>
                            <h3>Pop-Up Phishing</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Phishing messages presented through pop-ups while a user is browsing, asking them to enter sensitive details or download harmful software. </p>
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A pop-up claiming, "Your computer is infected! Click here to download antivirus software," which installs malware instead.</p>
                            <h3>Social Media Phishing</h3> 
                            <p><b>Explanation:</b>Attackers use fake profiles, direct messages, or posts on social media to lure victims into revealing personal details or clicking on malicious links.</p>  
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A scammer posing as a friend sends a message on social media, asking, "Can you check out this photo I found of you?" and provides a malicious link.</p>

                        <div class="dropdown-content">
                            <p>To protect yourself and your organization from phishing attacks, implement the following solutions:</p>
                            <h3>Increase Awareness and Education</h3>  
                            <p><b>Solution:</b> Regularly train employees and individuals to recognize phishing attempts and suspicious behaviors. </p> 
                            <p><b>How:</b> 
                            <p>Conduct workshops, webinars, or online courses on identifying phishing emails, texts, or calls. </p>
                            <p>Use simulated phishing attacks to test and strengthen users' awareness.</p>
                            <h3>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
                            <p><b>Solution:</b>Require multiple forms of verification, such as passwords and one-time codes.</p>  
                            <p><b>Why:</b>MFA makes it harder for attackers to access accounts even if they obtain login credentials.</p> 
                            <p><b>Example:</b>Using SMS codes, authentication apps, or biometric verification along with passwords.</p>
                            <h3>Enable Email Security Filters</h3>  
                            <p><b>Solution:</b>Employ advanced email filtering to block phishing emails.</p> 
                            <p><b>How:</b></p>

                            Cyber threats come in different forms, and phishing is just one type of attack. Here’s how phishing compares to malware, ransomware, and social engineering:
                            
                            <h3>Malware</h3>
                            <p>Malicious software designed to damage, steal, or spy on data.</p>
                            <p>Includes viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware.</p>
                            <p><b>Example:</b> Clicking a fake link that downloads a Trojan virus, giving hackers access to your files.</p>
                            <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                            <p>A type of malware that locks files or entire systems until a ransom is paid.</p>
                            <p>Often spread through phishing emails or malicious downloads.</p>
                            <p><b>Example:</b> A fake invoice email contains a ransomware attachment, encrypting all files until payment is made.</p>
                            <h3>Social Engineering</h3>
                            <p>A psychological manipulation tactic where attackers exploit human trust to gain access to sensitive information.</p>
                            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering, but other examples include impersonation, tailgating, and baiting.</p>
                            <p><b>Example:</b>A hacker calls an employee, pretending to be IT support, and tricks them into revealing their login details.</p>
